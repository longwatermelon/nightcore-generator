~~This does not work on windows for me, not sure if i just screwed up my python install or if it's just somehow incompatible~~

You need ffmpeg for this along with the packages listed in requirements.txt. I already had ffmpeg previously installed by accident so I didnt know it was required

# Usage
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 nightcore.py "search term"
```
